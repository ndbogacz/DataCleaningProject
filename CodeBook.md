VARIABLE NAMES AND DETAILS

Activity - Text - Name of the activity being performed for the data collected in the given record

Subject - Number - ID number of the subject for whom the data was collected in the given record

The remaining 66 variables are summary statistics for each activity/subject pair.  For each pair, the value for each of the "feature" variables in the mean of all such measures for each variable.  The "feature" variables are all of the mean and standard deviations measures from the original data.  These variables represent various aspects of device readings for wearable technologies during their testing process.  Their names are as follows:

"tBodyAcc.mean...X"           
"tBodyAcc.mean...Y"
